# Check back for my feedback and comments often. 


## Initial Feedback 12-12-2017

- The app is looking good. 
- You have a lot of information contained in it. 
- The graphing functions on the first page seem slow to change, is this just my computer or have there been issues on your machine as well. 
- The Temperature variation map downloads but does not display properly. 
- For the air quality index, you may want to add a way to reset it. Once you start clicking cities the plots become very filled. 


## Class Project Feedback


### What your classmates liked

- important topic, lots of information and good visualizations
- Substantial information and data analysis functions. 
- Love the air quality map
- Very practical use for real life problems. Added complex cluster graphs. Pointer getting specific data point information, complex graphs
- It's an important idea; the way it's divided is intuitive; the graphs are pretty; and the comparison graphs are useful. 
- The app has a lot of information and useful graphs to make comparison. And it's easy to select different places of interest and pollutant to using the button. 
- The graphs are really fancy and have many functions.
- a lot of functionality, very clean layout, seems intuitive to use
- The topic is important and I thought they had a lot of data
box plots and other visualizations
- Very detail and a lot of information available for the user
- I like the approach the group took to connect environment predictor to health variables.
- The dynamic change of size and number graphs with different selection.
- "- The app is very though, functional, and well organized. Very creative ways of analyzing and displaying data! 
- Graphs are clearly labeled, and visually appealing. I loved that you could point anywhere in the map and get the AQI for that particular state"
- I thought the US maps look really nice. There seems like you could find out a lot of information.
- I like it and that's why I chose this topic.
- The app nicely summarized a lot of data with interesting graphs
- Very useful. It is close to our daily life.
- Interesting topic and factors considered for the environment and health. A plethora of information displayed on the app and amazing visuals. 
- This one was spectacular so much information! This could be a full fledge hub for any government website.
-Very comprehensive graphs and calculations
- Good idea, probably a good app for researchers
- "- has nice graphs that communicate the idea well
- interesting and useful epidemiology topic
- nice gis map
- good uX - it is good that it gives the user freedom to choose colour on the gis"
the collaboration and effort 
- It has a lot of contents in it. 


### What they suggest for improvement

- often unclear what graphs are displaying, not sure interpretation of boxplots was accurate, error message was returned, use user-friendly variable labels, years should be displayed without commas
- Maybe a title panel or logo on main page. More distinct colour differentiation on map visualization. 
- Maybe define the variables better so that its easy to understand and interpret.
- Add units to some graphs
- Using "Input" or "Output" rather than "X Variable" or "Y Variable" would be more intuitive for users to use. If there was a way to center the user inputs by putting it in the main panel rather than side, it would look nicer. "Calculator" in the calculator panel (not label but actual panel) is misspelled. - Putting more than just the level of health concern (e.g., a description of it) would make it easier for the user. 
- The overall app is very nice. I think it's better for the group to add some background introduction of different pollutants and the output. 
- The change of air conditions in the past 10 years.
-maybe add some more text under different graphs with some general interpretations so users who are not familiar with the data can easily understand what they are looking at
- Without having someone to walk you through it, it is confusing on what every aspect does. I think more detailed instructions are needed
-health calculator output. 
- Minor polishing, I think there were some typos/spelling errors within the app
- There should be a bit of an intro to guide the users through the various inputs that this app requires.
- The app requires a lot of packages to run but there are some errors when installing the packages.
- It would be helpful to get a message displaying that the red dot in the plot represents the air quality in the area chosen by the user. This was not very clear. I would also be useful to display a message that indicates the user when to use a bar graph instead of a line plot. 
- I think maybe you could have default values set, so the user can see how it should work. Maybe add directions.
- Could do something to make it run faster?
- The code took a lot of time to run (to install all the packages). Making it faster would work better. - Also, hide the error messages in the output panel.
Health and environment related areas.
- Maybe, print out a textoutput what the graphs display because with so many variables incorporated hard to keep track.  
- Maybe describe a use case scenario for a lay person to use it? Tell more of a story? 
- A better introduction
- The app should include introduction and concept definitions because the concepts are not widely known to the general public (if this is intended for the public). There include explanation of the statistic descriptions. 
- use the shiny busy indicator when data is loading
- The workflow could be improved. I had to manually open some functions to get the app to work. 
- It will be a lot better if the data behind this app can update automatically, so that it will be more useful.


### Things to do before turning it in

- Correct Spelling mistakes
- Create a tab with an introduction. Use markdown and some screenshots to make this introduction look professional
- Make sure packages and everything installs without any kind of bugs. Also there should be nothing the user has to do other than click run app.
